                <h1>C Tutorial</h1>
                <p>
                    C is a general-purpose, procedural, imperative computer programming language developed in
                    1972 by Dennis M. Ritchie at the Bell Telephone Laboratories to develop the UNIX operating
                    system. C is the most widely used computer language. It keeps fluctuating at number one
                    scale of popularity along with Java programming language, which is also equally popular and
                    most widely used among modern software programmers.
                </p>
                <h1>Audience</h1>
                <p>
                    This tutorial is designed for software programmers with a need to understand the C
                    programming language starting from scratch. This tutorial will give you enough understanding
                    on C programming language from where you can take yourself to higher level of expertise.
                </p>
                <h1>Prerequisites</h1>
                <p>
                    Before proceeding with this tutorial, you should have a basic understanding of Computer
                    Programming terminologies. A basic understanding of any of the programming languages will
                    help you in understanding the C programming concepts and move fast on the learning
                    track.
